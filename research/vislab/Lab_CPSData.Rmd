## Instructions

**Important:** Make sure you delete this entire section before you submit your file to RPubs!

In your groups, tackle the `CPS85` dataset within the `mosaicData` package. You may want to type `?CPS85` and `head(CPS85)` to get a glimpse at what this dataset contains. Next, start exploring the dataset using plots, tables, and other numeric summaries. Select 3 favorite plots and tell a story (in writing) about each of them. Extra brownie points if you can weave the 3 plots together into one cohesive story. You should include at least 1 univariate and 1 bivariate plot. 

## PLOT 1

```{r}
# put the code for your plot here

## PLOT 2

# put the code for your plot here
```

(Include the description for your plot here.)

## PLOT 3

```{r}
