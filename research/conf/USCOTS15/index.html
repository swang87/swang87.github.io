  <h3>The Activity</h3>
  <b>Goal:</b> To decrease the time-to-first-graph for students; to practice statistical thinking motivated by real data and to engage in basic statistical computing early on.<br> 
  <b>Time:</b> approximately 50 minutes or more <br>
<b>Software:</b> R (with <a href="http://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> and the <a href="http://mosaic-web.org/r-packages/">mosaic</a> package).<br>

<b>Task:</b>
<p>  Using an RMarkdown file, produce 3 compelling graphics that tell a story about the <i>CPS85</i> dataset (built into the <i>mosaicData</i> package). Write a few sentences describing what you learn from each of the three plots.
</p>
<p><i>Note: At Amherst, we are fortunate enough to have our very own RStudio Server, which means the students do not need to install anything on their own computers to get started on this lab. If your institution does not have this luxury, then you may need to budget additional time to install the necessary software.</i></p>
