          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Born in Nanjing, China, I moved to the United States at a young age. I have spent a great deal of my life in Toronto, Canada (eh); 
            Boca Raton, FL; Berkeley, CA; and New Haven, CT. I am currently living in Amherst, MA.</p>       
            <p>
              Fresh out of my undergraduate studies at Berkeley, I spent some time working as an actuary in a large consulting firm. Soon, I hungered for something more cutting-edge, and joined an exciting new startup then called WeatherBill (now called The Climate Corporation). There, I did a lot of work on pricing weather derivatives and analyzing potential clients' weather risks.

              After obtaining my PhD in Statistics from Yale University, I subsequently started working as a Lecturer of Statistics in beautiful Amherst College.
