          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Born in Nanjing, China, I moved to the United States at a young age. I have spent a great deal of my life in Toronto, Canada (eh); 
            Boca Raton, FL; Berkeley, CA; and New Haven, CT. </p>       
            <p>
              Fresh out of my undergraduate studies at Berkeley, I spent some time working as an actuary in a large consulting firm. After a while, I thirsted for something more cutting edge, and joined an exciting new startup then called WeatherBill (now called The Climate Corporation). There, I did a lot of work on pricing weather derivatives and analyzing potential clients' weather risks. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I greatly enjoyed data analysis and working with large amounts of data, but in order to work more effectively, I needed to go back to school. Now I am almost ready to get back to work!

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <h4>Music</h4>
          <p>I have a karaoke machine, so I sometimes invite friends over to sing a bit. Sometimes I'll sing opera. I also play the piano and have been non-commitally learning the guitar.</p>
          <h4>Programming</h4>
          <p>I started learning HTML when I was age 11 and ColdFusion when I was age 14. Luckily, I got to do some programming (in Java) in my last job, and my research also involves quite a bit of R/C++ programming.</p>
          <p>I didn't do too well in my first year in the <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/">Google Code Jam</a>, but hopefully once I've mastered Python, I'll do much better next year!</p>
          <h4>Cooking</h4>
          <p>Cooking and baking is a great deal of fun, and stress-relieving, particularly when it's time to sample one's creations! See my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/files/macarons.jpg">macarons</a> here.</p>
