This is adapted from Examples 9.10 (p. 469) and 9.16 (p. 485) of the book. 

## The Data

In this example, we consider the rate of success on the golf course as a function of the length of the putt. 

```{r}
data(Putts1)
summary(Putts1)
```

## Choose and Fit

We'd like to begin by constructing an empirical logit plot to assess whether a logistic regression model would be appropriate.

* Replicate the empirical logits in Table 9.5 in preparation for making the plot.

SOLUTION:

```{r}
props <- mean(Made ~ Length, data=Putts1)
props

props/(1-props)

logits <- logit(props)
```

* Make the empirical logit plot based on these numbers.

SOLUTION:

```{r}
xyplot(logits ~ 3:7, xlab="Distance", type=c("p", "r"), lty=2)
```

* Replicate the table on the bottom of p. 469. What does this table aim to achieve?

SOLUTION:

```{r}
# top 
exp(diff(logits))

# bottom
m1 <- glm(Made ~ Length, data=Putts1, family=binomial)
exp(coef(m1)[2])
```


## Assess and Use

* Display and interpret the model summary for your logistic regression model.

SOLUTION:

```{r}
summary(m1)
exp(-0.566)
```

* Calculate the likelihood test statistic based on the summary table. Compare it to a chi-square distribution with appropriate degree of freedom. What do you conclude?

SOLUTION: 

```{r}
G <- 800.21 - 719.89
pchisq(G, df=1, lower.tail=F)
1-pchisq(G, df=1) # less desirable
```


* Confirm that the `anova()` calculation matches what you found above.

SOLUTION: 

```{r}
anova(m1, test = "Chisq")
```
