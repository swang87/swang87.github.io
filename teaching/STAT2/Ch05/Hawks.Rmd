```{r include=FALSE}
# Don't delete this chunk if you are using the mosaic package
# This loads the mosaic and dplyr packages
require(mosaic)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# Some customization.  You can alter or delete as desired (if you know what you are doing).

# This changes the default colors in lattice plots.
trellis.par.set(theme=theme.mosaic())  

# knitr settings to control how R chunks work.
require(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small"    # slightly smaller font for code
)
# This loads the mosaic data sets.  (Could be deleted if you are not using them.)

### The Data 

Data are collected by researchers at Cornell on random samples of three different species of hawks: red-tailed,sharp-shinned, and Cooper's hawks. We are interested in the tail lengths of these birds and how they might vary between different species.  

```{r}
data(Hawks)
head(Hawks)
```

### Fit

* Calculate group means and the grand mean. Then calculate the treatment effects for the one-way ANOVA model.

SOLUTION:

```{r}

```

* Fit the model.

SOLUTION:

```{r}

```


### Assess

* Check the conditions for the model.

SOLUTION:

```{r, fig.keep='last'}

```

```{r, fig.keep='last'}

```

* What can we conclude?

SOLUTION:
